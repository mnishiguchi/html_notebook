# Notes

==

## Semantic HTML
- HTML should be **semantic**.
  + e.g., There should not bemore than one `h1` tags
  + e.g., Download section is often `h4`.  
  
- Do not think about how the document will look when working on HTML.
  + e.g., Use `strong` and `em` instead of `bold` and `italic`

==

## Specificity has more precedence

- `ul li` > `li`

==

&#x5FCD;
```

## Preparation for creating a website

- Mockups / wire frames
- [Style tiles](http://styletil.es/)
     
==

## CSS reset

- A web browser has its own styles.

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```

==

## Margin vs Padding

- Be aware of the border of each element
- Then, determine which to use margin or padding

```css
* {
    border: 1px dotted red;
}
```

==

## Inline element
- does not take margin

==

# Position
- Every element is static by default.
- 

```css
#special


```

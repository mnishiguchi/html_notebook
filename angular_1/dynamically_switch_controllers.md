# [Dynamic Controllers in Directives with the undocumented "name" property @toddmotto](https://toddmotto.com/dynamic-controllers-in-directives-with-the-undocumented-name-property/)

## Potential usage:

- Single base template
- Transcludes different content
- Different controllers are instantiated based on content
- First Controller might assign a different template + controller but maintain the same "base" Directive and wrapped behaviour you might be looking for
